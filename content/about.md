I am in job market in Fall 2025!!!

I am currently a 5th year PhD student at Cornell University in Mathematics. My advisor is [David Zywina](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~zywina/). I am interested in number theory and arithmetic geometry. My work focuses on computational aspects of modular curves, abelian varieties, gonality of curves and local points on curves.
