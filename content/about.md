I am on the job market in Fall 2025!

I am currently a 6th year mathematics PhD student at Cornell University. My advisor is [David Zywina](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~zywina/). I am broadly interested in number theory and arithmetic geometry. My work focuses on computational aspects of modular curves, GL2-type abelian varieties, gonality of algebraic curves and various descent phenomenon.
